This can inspire one to write in a more casual manner. There are some advantages of keeping a diary. These benefits include improved emotional health and the ability to resolve traumatic experiences as a result of having a safe environment to convey your emotions.
But with time, many of us lost interest or dont have time to write diary or atleast maintain a diary at home. As the technology progress and many things have been digitalzied.. so why not diary?
